                <p class="mb-2">As part of the Energizing Education Programme (EEP) Phase II, the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) has commissioned a 2.5MW solar hybrid power plant at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), Kaduna. The project, implemented by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) under the oversight of the Nigeria Electrification Programme (NEP), was inaugurated by the Honourable Minister of Power, Chief Adebayo Adelabu. This milestone initiative is aligned with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's agenda and aims to enhance educational infrastructure, boost campus security, and promote sustainable development across Nigerian institutions. </p>
                <p class="mb-2">Speaking at the event, the Managing Director/CEO of REA, Abba A. Aliyu, noted that the project represents more than just energy infrastructure. He described the initiative as a platform for enabling socio-economic growth, environmental sustainability, and talent development. </p> 
                <p class="mb-2">"I would like to say, what we are commissioning now is not just a power plant, we are commissioning social development, economic development, sustainable research development and a pipeline of talent development." He said.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">He acknowledged the foresight of the Minister of Power in positioning Nigeria as a renewable energy leader on the African continent, reinforcing the country's ambition to become the hub for renewable energy across Africa.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">"In line with the Honourable Minister's vision, we are now channeling efforts to establish Nigeria as the renewable energy hub of Africa. That is the direction in which we are heading," he affirmed.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">Alhaji Abba added that the agency had secured over $3 billion in financing to drive energy transition efforts, with implementation frameworks developed under the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) model.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">"We have mobilized more than $3 billion of which we are using to drive this energy transition. and have created a framework that enables local and international partnerships under RESCOs,". He explained.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">In his remark, Olufemi Akinyelure Head, Nigeria Electrification Programme, emphasized the importance of institutional ownership and long-term sustainability. He encouraged the NDA management to take full responsibility for operating and maintaining the facility, assuring that REA-NEP sustainability framework is already in place to support ongoing use.
                    "The success of this project hinges on sustainability and long-term operational efficiency. We urge the Academy to take full ownership of the systems, while we continue to roll out our sustainability strategies. The plan is currently operational, and I believe the Commandant can confirm that the institution is already benefiting from this power supply" he said.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">Overall, The REA-NEP is making significant strides in localizing energy solutions under energizing education programme II as one of the components of NEP with working target of providing 32MW renewable off grid solar hybrid to 7 Federal universities and 2 affiliated hospital across Nigeria, along installation of 1500 streetlights powered with solar source of energy, with 153, 239 students to be energized at the completion of the programme.</p>
